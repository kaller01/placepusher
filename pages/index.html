    Place pusher
  </h1>
  <p>
    Create a push, list the pixels and what colors need to be changed and then submit. Send the link to your place group
    and everyone gets a pixel assigned to them. See status in realtime, how many users are holding a pixel. To have a
    pixel assigned, you need to be connected with sockets, meaning if one user is holding a pixel and closes the website
    it will deassign. You can have multiple tabs open if you have multiple reddit accounts, on pixel will be assigned per tab.
